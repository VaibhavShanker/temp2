<h1>Page heading</h1>

<p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.</p>
<p>Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and
   recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems
   like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop
   serious illness.</p>
<p>The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the
   disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands
   or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face. </p>
<p>The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an
   infected person coughs or sneezes, so it’s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette 
   (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).</p>
<p>At this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19. However, there are many
   ongoing clinical trials evaluating potential treatments. WHO will continue to provide updated 
   information as soon as clinical findings become available.</p>
