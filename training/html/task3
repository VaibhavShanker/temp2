<p style="margin-left:30px;">Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.</p>
<p style="margin-left:30px;">Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and
   recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems
   like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop
   serious illness.</p>
<p style="margin-left:30px;">The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the
   disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands
   or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face. </p>
<p style="margin-left:30px;">The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an
   infected person coughs or sneezes, so it’s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette 
   (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).</p>
<p style="margin-left:30px;">At this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19. However, there are many
   ongoing clinical trials evaluating potential treatments. WHO will continue to provide updated 
   information as soon as clinical findings become available.</p>
<p style="margin-left:30px;">Seek immediate medical attention if you have serious symptoms.  Always call before visiting your doctor or health facility. 

People with mild symptoms who are otherwise healthy should manage their symptoms at home. 

On average it takes 5–6 days from when someone is infected with the virus for symptoms to show, however it can take up to 14 days. </p>

<p style="margin-left:15px;">Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your
   national and local public health authority. Most countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and
   many are experiencing outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing their
   outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.</p>
